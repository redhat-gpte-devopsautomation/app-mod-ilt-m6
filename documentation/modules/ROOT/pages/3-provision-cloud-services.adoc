= Provision Red Hat OpenShift application services

== Goals of this lab

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/application-services[Red Hat OpenShift Application Services,role=external,window=_blank] is a growing collection of managed cloud services which provide a streamlined developer experience to design and manage API specifications and schemas, manage and secure APIs, and build and deploy event streams based applications.

Globex decides to use Red Hat OpenShift API Management which is a fully Red Hat managed API traffic control and API program management solution that includes analytics, access control, developer workflows, and more. 

In this workshop, you will use the Red Hat OpenShift API Management Developer Sandbox, which is a trial environment for RHOAM, which provides you with a free 30-day trial environment allowing you to explore the benefits of the fully managed service.

In this section of the lab, you will 

* Register for  RHOAM Developer Sandbox, and create a RHOAM tenant for you to use
* Provision a Service Registry instance to host the API schemas


== Register for a Developer sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift API Management (RHOAM)

. Register for a RHOAM sandbox by clicking on the red *Launch your RHOAM OpenShift Developer Sandbox* button on the https://red.ht/rhoam-sandbox[Developer Sandbox use case activities page,role=external,window=_blank]. You are redirected to a login page. Login with the Red Hat account that you created in the previous step.
. You are redirected back to the Developer Sandbox use case activities page. To prevent the creation of fraudulent accounts, your sandbox account needs to be validated with a phone verification step.

. Once you enter the code received on your phone, your RHOAM sandbox will be ready to use. Click the *Start using your RHOAM sandbox* button.
. You are redirected to the Developer Sandbox login screen. Click the *DevSandbox* button to log into your OpenShift Sandbox.

. If this is the first time you use the Red Hat account on the Developer Sandbox, you are redirected to a Terms and Conditions page. Check the *I have read and agree to all the terms and conditions below* check box. Feel free to uncheck the *I would like to receive...* check boxes if you want to opt out from receiving marketing emails. Click *Submit*.
. The final step in the registration process is an email verification step. An email is sent to the email address attached to your Red Hat account, with a verification link. Access your email, open the email (the subject is `Verify email for Red Hat account` ), and copy the verification link.

* From the *Projects* dropdown on the top of the page, set the project namespace as *<username>-dev* from the projects that have been already created for you.
* Click on *Search* from the left navigation
* Click on *Resources* to search for `APIManagementTenant` and select it.

* You are taken to the YAML configuration of this resource. Click the *Create* button at the bottom of the YAML displayed.
* You are taken to the Details page of this resource. Click on the *YAML* tab to view the changes to the YAML configuration.
* Watch for changes to the YAML of the APIManagementTenant resource, and wait for the status to be displayed at the bottom of the YAML to become `status.provisioningStatus: 3scale account ready`

The API Management Tenant account is now provisioned and is ready for use. 
This may take a couple of minutes. 
* To access OpenShift API Management, select *Project* from the menu on the left, and in the *Launcher* pane on the right side, select *API Management*.
+

== Provision a Service Registry instance

In this step you provision a Service Registry instance on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. The Service Registry instance will be used in this workshop to store OpenAPI spec documents.

. Navigate to https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com,role=external,window=_blank] and log in with your Red Hat account credentials.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you created a new Red Hat account as explained in the previous section, you should already be logged in into the Hybrid Cloud Console.
You will need to accept another set of terms and conditions in order to create a Service Registry instance.
====

. On the https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com] landing page, select *Application and Data Services* from the menu on the left.

. On the Application Services landing page, select *Service Registry â†’ Service Registry Instances*.
+
image::console-redhat-com-service-registry-instances.png[]

. On the *Service Registry Instances* overview page, click the *Create Service Registry instance* button. Enter `globex` as the name of the instance and click *Create*. This starts the provisioning process for your Service Registry instance.

. The new Service Registry instance is listed in the instances table. After a couple of seconds, your instance should be marked as ready.
