= Adding API Management capabilities to the application

== Introduction

Once the backend teams fully develop the APIs backends, the APIs can be published for external consumption with an API management platform.  Globoex uses the Red Hat managed https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/openshift-api-management[Red Hat OpenShift API Management (RHOAM),role=external,window=product_page] for managing these APIs. The external teams such as mobile team will be able to user the built-in developer portal of RHOAM to sign up for various application plans. 

== Goals of this lab
In this part of the workshop you will 

* Use the Red Hat OpenShift API Management (RHOAM) Developer Sandbox that you configured earlier in the lab. 
* Import the already deployed Product Catalog API and manage it with OpenShift API Management
* Test secure access of the API
* View the traffic analytics generated

== Access Red Hat OpenShift API Management
. Navigate to the browser tab pointing to the OpenShift API Management dashboard on Developer Sandbox. +
If you closed the browser tab, refer to the instructions in the _Provision Red Hat OpenShift Application Services_ section.
. Notice the sample API which has been already set up.

== Create an API Product

A product is a customer-facing API that packages one or more backends. You will create an API Product manually with the following instructions:

. In the Dashboard, under the APIs section, click *Create Product* in the *Products* card.

== Create applications for the default account

[NOTE]
====
An application is always associated with an application plan. Applications are stored within developer accounts.
====

. Click on the selector option at the top of the window and choose *Audience*.
. Navigate to *Accounts > Listing* from the left side menu.
. For the purpose of this lab, you will use the default `Developer` account that has already been created.
+
image::rhoam-developer-account.png[]
. Click on the `+++<u>1 Application</u>+++` link on the top of the page to navigate to the *Application tab* of this account.
+
image::rhoam-audience-add-app.png[]
. You will see the list of applications associated to this user. Note that there is already the default application which has been associated with this user. 
. Click *Create Application*. You will view the *New Application* page.
. Choose the following details in the *New Application* page:
+
image::rhoam-create-app.png[]
+
[options=header] 
[cols="1,2"] 
|==============================================================
| Field             | Value
| Product           | `globex-product-catalog`
| Application plan  | `globex-product-catalog-app-plan`
| Name              |  `globex-product-catalog-application`
| Description       | `Globex Product Catalog Developer App`
|==============================================================

. You can see your new application details now:
+
image::rhoam-create-app-success.png[]
. Make a note of the `User Key` that is displayed under the *API Credentials* section. This will be used while making calls to the API.


== Test integration of the API

. Navigate to *Product* > *globex-product-catalog* > *Integration* > *Configuration*
. Under *APIcast Configuration*, click *Promote to Staging APIcast* to promote the new APIcast configuration to staging.
+
image::rhoam-promote-staging.png[]

. To test requests to your API product, copy the URL provided along with the curl command in the *Example curl for testing* section. 
+
image::rhoam-curl-test-api.png[]
. Include the path `services/products` in the URL so that it looks like this
`https://globex-product-catalog-jaya-rhoam101-apicast-staging.apps.rhoam-ds-prod.xe9u.p1.openshiftapps.com:443/services/products?user_key=5f378fb68add26d7c9a17a0d725f9afa`
. Paste the URL in the address field of a browser tab and press `enter`.
. You will see the response JSON being displayed:
+
image::rhoam-final-response.png[]
** To check if the API Management is actually securing the API, try altering the api_key's value in the URL. You will receive an `Authentication failed` error.


== View Traffic Analytics
. Back in the API Mangement portal, Click on the *Analytics -> Traffic* link on the left hand side menu for the `globex-product-catalog` product.
