= Setting up mocks to help with parallel development

Now that the OpenAPI specs are finalised, creation of API mocks will enable parallel development streams leading to rapid inner loop development. 

* The various  dev teams (such as mobile dev) do not need to wait for the APIs to be completely developed and instead can use these mocks to get realistic responses. 
* Backend developers in parallel build the backend applications APIs using modern cloud-native frameworks such as https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus^, window=product-page]. 

There are a number of ways to mock APIs including microcks, postman etc. In this labs you will use hosted Postman.

== Goals of this lab
* Setup Postman as a tool to mock the APIs using the OpenAPI schema
* Import one of the APIs 
* Test the imported API using the mock server and look for the change made to one of the examples in the API Designer

== Setup Postman
. Access Postman at link:https://www.postman.com/[postman^, window=postman]. Click on *Sign Up for Free*.
. You can now either create a new user or sign-up with Google. 
+

. You can provide your name and other details after signing in if prompted.
. You will be prompted with a *How would you like to start* popup if this is the first time you are logging in. You can ignore this prompt by using the <esc> key on your keyboard.

. Navigate to the *Homepage*, locate the *Import an existing file* section and click on *Import file-->*.

== Import the ProductCatalogAPI

. You will now see the *Import* wizard with multiple options.
+

. The next step is to import the OpenAPI spec from Service Registry. 
* Navigate to the https://console.redhat.com/beta/application-services/service-registry[Service Registry^,window=service-registry]. Login with your Red Hat account if necessary.
* Navigate to the `globex` instance and from there to `globex / ProductCatalogAPI`. 
* You can either retrieve the specs as OpenAPI spec as (a) *raw text* or (b) *a file* and then import this into Postman.

.. *If you are importing OpenAPI spec as raw text*
+
** In the Service Registry browser tab, click on the *Content* tab. Copy the specifications content shown in this page into the memory (`Ctrl-A` and `Ctrl-C`).
+

** Navigate to the Postman window browser tab which is already open.
** Click on the *Raw text* option of the *Import* popup and paste the content from the memory (`Ctrl-V`) into the text area.
+
image:postman-rawtext.png[]
** Click on *Continue*. 

.. *If you are importing OpenAPI spec as file*
+
** In the Service Registry browser tab, click on the *Documentation* tab. Click on the *Download* button. Make a note of where the file is downloaded on your laptop.
+

** Navigate back to the Postman window browser tab where you have *Import* wizard open.
** Click on the *File* option of the *Import* wizard.
+
image:postman-import-popup.png[]
** You can either drag the file into this window or clik on *Upload Files* to import the file downloaded from Service Registry
** You will be auto-navigated to the next step.

. You will now see the API's name and a few other details populated in the *Import* wizard.
+

`
. Click on *Import*. 
. You will be notified that import is complete. Click the *Close* button.
. Explore the `Product Catalog API` that has been imported.
* Note that the Collections and APIs are prepopulated

== Setup Postman mock server
. The next step is to setup a mock server on Postman which will then showcase how it can be useful for developers while the actual API backend is still under developement.
. Click on *Mock Servers* on the left-hand navigation, and choose the *Create Mock Server* option.
+
image::postman-mock-landing.png[]
. On the right pane, choose *Select an existing collection*, and then choose `ProductCatalogAPI`
+
image:postman-mock-chooseapi.png[]
. Give the mock server a name, for example `ProductCatalog Mock Server` and click on *Create Mock Server* at the bottom of the page.
+
image::postman-mock-create-server.png[]
. You will be shown details of the mock server URL. Make a note of the URL.
+

== Test the imported API using the mock server
. Explore *Collections* menu from the left-hand side, and you will be able to see the examples that have been already created while the API was designed.
. Click on the `Get list of product by id` from the `Product Catalog API`. This opens a tab on Postman which you can use to issue a request.
+
image::postman-choose-prodbyid.png[] 

. Replace the `{{baseUrl}}` in the address field with the Mock server's URL, and click *Send*.
. You can view the list of products in the bottom panel. Note that the name of the Quarkus T-shirt now says `Jaya's Awesome Quarkus T-shirt` (or the name you have for this product)
+

In the next step, you will learn to protect the API by using Red Hat OpenShift API Management.
