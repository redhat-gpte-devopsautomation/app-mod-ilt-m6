= Design APIs with OpenShift API Designer

== Introduction
As part of the API-First approach, the first step  - of course - is to design those APIs. API Designer is a tool to design your APIs (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI) and schemas (Apache Avro, Google Protobuf, JSON Schema). You can manage your collection of API and schema designs by creating, importing, and editing. Save your work by downloading your designs locally or by exporting them to OpenShift Service Registry. 


== Goals of this lab
In this section you will import an existing API that will be used as a starting point, explore the designer while making a few minor edits and then export this to a Service Registry

API Designer is under `Service preview` and can be accessed through the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console via https://console.redhat.com/beta/application-services/api-designer[API Designer^, window=api-designer]

*Note:* +
OpenShift API Designer is in Beta and all your designs are stored locally in your browser. Clearing your browser cache or switching to a new browser might result in loss of data. Make sure you save your work by downloading your designs locally or by exporting them to a Red Hat OpenShift Service Registry instance.


== Import API 

. Navigate to https://console.redhat.com/beta/application-services/api-designer[OpenShift API Designer^,window=api-designer] and if needed login using your Red Hat account.
. On the landing page, click on the *Import design* button and choose the *Import from URL* option.

. Paste the following URL into the URL field and click on the *Fetch* button.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]

. Observe  the fields that are populated with the data from the imported API specifications. Click on the *Import* button to import the specs into the API Designer

. You can now view  the `Product Catalog API` on the browser. You can explore the Paths, Data Types and Responses that are part of this API.

== Explore and edit the API 
. Click on the `product-list` under the `Responses` section
. Click on the `2 example(s) defined` link. You will see the list of examples given

. On moving the mouse over the examples, you can choose to click on the *Edit* button shown as a *pencil icon*. This opens the example's content.

. Replace the name of the first product by appending your name. I've changed this from `Quarkus T-shirt` to `Jaya's Awesome Quarkus T-shirt`

. Make sure you click  on the *Edit* button to confirm your edits.
+

. Click on the *Save* button on the top-right corner to save your edits.

== Export this API into the Service Registry
The next step is to export this API into the Service Registry so that this can be used as a single source of truth by the developers.

. Click on the `Action` button found on the top-right corner.
+

. Choose the `Export to Service Registry` option from the drop down

. Fill the form `Export to Service Registry` with the following details. Click on the `Export` button to complete the action.
